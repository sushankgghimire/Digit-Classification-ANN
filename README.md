# Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have garnered significant attention due to their effectiveness in various machine learning tasks, particularly image classification. ANNs are renowned for their
capability to learn complex patterns and relationships from data, and they have revolutionized the field of computer vision. In this study, we delve into the application of ANNs to classify images from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset comprises a collection of handwritten digits, each represented as a grayscale image. Our objective is to harness the power of ANNs to accurately classify these images into their respective numerical classes (0 to 9). This research aims to explore the potential of ANNs in discerning intricate features and characteristics that distinguish different digits. By utilizing layers of interconnected neurons, ANNs can capture hierarchical features from raw pixel values. This involves learning and fine-tuning weights that enable the network to recognize distinctive patterns in the images. The training process involves feeding the
network a large set of labeled images and iteratively adjusting the weights to minimize the classification error. The paper also focuses on comparing the results on the models by using different weight initialization approaches. The Kaiming and Xavier initialization approaches bring different results to the vanilla approach of training a model. Furthermore, the fundamentals of a neural network with dropout layers are designed from the scratch to test their performance.
